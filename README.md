# link-tree
1. In Index.html you may change the image src with your image and the alt text
2. In Index.html you may change the links and the name in the H3 section

3. In style.css we are are using      background-repeat: no-repeat;  so our gradient background doesn't start again
4. You may adjust     border-radius: 50%;  to your desired size this one looks best


Dont forget to use LiveServer to see all your work in progress.

Have fun making your link tree clone!!!
